# Object-Oriented Python

Scripts contain some exemplary classes. I most of them tried to utilize `pydocs` with `doctest` package, encapsulation with `@property` and `@<name>.setter` decorators, inheritance, overriding default methods like `__str__`, `__add__` etc.
 - `main.py` contains some simplistic console program utilizing classes from `bank_account.py`
 - `factorial.py` - simple factorial function but with tests for `doctest`
 - `pydoc_generator.py` - Pydoc generator from dictionary description of class. Dictionary could be derived from some text analysis of source code - TODO
 - `robot.py` - Simulation of robot moving on a board with limited power. Encapsulation tests with getters and setters
 - `vehicles.py` - Inheritance test several classes, Amphibian inherits from both Boat and Vehicle.
 - `worker.py` - Classes Worker and Manager, for some simple HR administration
